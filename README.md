# MATH_2270_002_SPRING_2024


This is MATH 2270-002, the introductory linear algebra class at the University of Utah. 

---

In this course we'll start studying linear structures from a concrete and computational point of view via matrices and eventually also develop a more abstract understanding of linearities. We will discuss and study the proofs of many theorems such as the Spectral Theorem and Singular Value Decomposition, although our main concern ultimately will be the demonstration and application of such theorems. Through this course, students will gain not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills relevant to real-world problems in science and technology.
